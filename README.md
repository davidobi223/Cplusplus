This is a banking project that I made for analyzing a users investment amount, years, and interest, with the outcome showing how much money they will accumulate over the months or years during their investment. I wouldn't say I had any downfalls with this project, overall I believe I did a good job and got the results I wanted. I'm not sure how I could've made this code more secure, but I could probably use Python since it's involved with actual banking firms. The most challenging part of this code was to make the calculations and lining the menu up. For this, I just did some simple googles on the math and the menu just needed extra time for the adjusting . For future projects I can use this one as a stepping stone especially if it's involving banking. I can use the development of the calculations in different projects and learn how to improve from there as well. All in all, this is a very readable program and easy to adjust/adapt if need be.
